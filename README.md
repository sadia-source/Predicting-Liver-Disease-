# Predicting Liver Disease Using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree
## Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises 10 clinical and demographic features related to liver disease, including liver enzyme levels, bilirubin concentrations, and patient age. Initial analysis revealed outliers and missing values, which were addressed by removing outliers and imputing missing data. Additionally, I balanced the dataset using SMOTE to ensure effective model training and improve predictive accuracy.



## Key variabale and description

1. age:The chronological age of the patient.
gender:
2. Gender refer to the sex.
3. Total_Bilirubin: this is the fers to the level of total bilirubin in the blood. Normal range is 0.2 to 1.2 mg/dL. Anything above 1.2 mg/dL is usually considered elevated. A total bilirubin level > 17.5 mg/dL is a criterion for predicting death and the need for liver transplantation.
4. Direct_Bilirubin: refers to the level of direct bilirubin in the blood.
5. Alkaline_Phosphotase:  refers to the level of alkaline phosphotase in the blood.
6. Alamine_Aminotransferase: refers to the level of alanine aminotransferase in the blood.
7. Aspartate_Aminotransferase: refers to the level of aspartate aminotransferase in the blood.
8. Total_Protiens: refers to the level of total proteins in the blood.

9. Albumin:refers to the level of albumin in the blood.

10. Albumin_Globulin_Ratio: refers to the value of albumin-globulin ratio.
11. Dataset: it represent the target value, there are two numbers Target = 1: This means the patient has liver disease.
Target = 2: This means the patient does not have liver diseas
